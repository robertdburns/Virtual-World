My event:
    when the screen is clicked, a cat spawns, any dudes around the cat turn into friendly dudes and follow the cat around, cats chase a fairy, if they come next to a fairy, eat the fairy then go to sleep.

how to trigger the event:
    click the screen at any valid point on the map that is not another entity.

what should happen when the event is triggered:
    when the mouse is clicked and the event is triggered, a field of flowers will spawn in a random area around the spawn location and a cat entity will spawn.
    Any dudes in the local area will be transformed into friendly dudes that will follow the cats around. The cats will target the nearest fairy. The cat will
    chase down the fairy until it is next to it, when it is next to the fairy, it eats it and goes to sleep.

what the affected entities should do:
    the local dude (s) will be transformed into friendly dudes that will
    follow the cat around while it hunts down the fairy.

what the new entity is and how it should behave:
    the cat that was spawned should chase down a fairy until it gets next to it, where it will eat it and go to sleep.
